also, if you've made a whole bunch of changes (commits) and decide you want to go back to what the application looked like last week, you can roll everything back
and if you decide you want to ditch all of the changes you've made since your last commit, because maybe what you were working on just wasn't working and you want to get back to a fresh state, just run `git reset --hard HEAD`

the -A . basically says "add EVERYTHING that's changed to the package"
now, if you want to see what's change in your application since your last commit, you can run `git diff`
which will show you the diff of the old and new files. + before a line means that was added, - before a line means it was removed

if you want a better look at what a commit is, check your git log
run `git log`

if you want a better look at what a commit is check your git log now if you want to see
